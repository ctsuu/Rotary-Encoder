Making Close Loop Servo System

Once we play open loop stepper motor system for a while, we will find that lossing steps is an unacceptable problem. We need look at some close loop approach. 

###Feedback Methods

There are few setpoint control options available, such as analog (potentiometer), pluse and direction, PWM, and port commands. More informations can refer to https://granitedevices.com/wiki/Setpoint_signal.
